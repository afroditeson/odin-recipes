    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10ounce) strip Steak</li>
        <li>salt and frehly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 small shallot, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 ounce fettuccine noodles</li>
        <li>5 ounce garlic and herb cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Let steak rest at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. 
            Pat steak dry with paper towels. 
            Season with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot. 
            Add butter, and immediately reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sear steak for 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare [135 degrees F (57 degrees C) internal temperature]. 
            During the last minute of cooking, add shallot and garlic to the pan. 
            Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter and shallot mixture over the steak repeatedly.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove the steak to a cutting board; do not wipe out the skillet. 
            Tent steak loosely with foil, and let rest for 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
             Add fettuccine and cook until tender with a bite, 8 to 10 minutes. 
             Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, drain the pasta, and set aside</li>
        <br>
        <li>In the same cast iron skillet over medium heat, whisk in cream cheese and heavy cream until smooth. 
            Gradually add reserved pasta water, starting with 1/4 cup and adding more as needed to achieve a creamy, pourable consistency. 
            Stir in lemon juice, taste, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add cooked fettuccine to the sauce, tossing to coat evenly. 
            If the sauce thickens too much, add more pasta water to loosen it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Divide the cooked fettuccine between 2 plates. 
            Sliced steak across the grain and place on top of pasta. 
            Sprinkle with minced parsley; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        
    </ol>
